### 21-DAY-CODING-CHALLENGE
Lighthouse Labs created the 21-Day Coding Challenge (#21DCC) 

# JavaScript (“JS” for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming language that, when applied to an HTML document, can provide dynamic interactivity on websites.

While there is a LOT to know about JavaScript, this prep resource is designed to point you directly to the concepts you’ll need to know to solve the 21 days of coding challenges ahead.

## Getting Started
# Syntax

# The Console

# Data Types in JavaScript

Data types are used to classify one particular type of data in programming languages. For instance, a number and a string of characters are different types of data that will be treated differently by JavaScript.

The data types we’ll be using in the 21DCC include:

* Strings
* Numbers
* Booleans
* Arrays
* Objects

### Focusing on FOCAL
The challenges in the 21 Day Coding Challenge will focus on something we at Lighthouse Labs like to call FOCAL. That stands for:

## Functions
## Objects
## Conditionals
## Arrays
## Loops
